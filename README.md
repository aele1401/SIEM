# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

Security Information and Event Management, also known as SIEM for short, is a tool that combines security information management and event management to show real-time events. This helps Cybersecurity professionals assess risks and mitigate those risks by detecting malicious activities and anomalies in the computing and network environment. 

Here you will find a project on log analysis and characterization using a SIEM called Splunk.
